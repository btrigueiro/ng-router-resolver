> Resolve routes from Angular Module

_Now in POC stage, PRs are welcome!_

This project is aimed to be used as a cli/programmatic tool with Angular projects
to statically analyze routes in `NgModules` and do some useful stuff with it.

As a use case you might want to generate some rules for ServiceWorker based on routes
to add some offline/cache capabilities to any Angular application.

## Current State

Currently it is in POC stage.

It parses given Angular TS module and collects all routes.

The limitation is that it cannot yet resolve routes from variables only from literals.

## Next Steps

- ~~Collect children routes~~ [DONE]
- ~~Collect lazy routes from other modules~~ [DONE]
- Support Identifiers in routes configuration (currently only object literals are supported)
- Support Spread operators in routes configuration
- Organize internal code structure to transition from POC to some stable version
